<br> </br>
This hit, that ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer, that white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls straight masterpieces
Styling, willing, living it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Got to kiss myself I'm so pretty
<br> </br>
I'm too hot
-hot damn-
Call the police and the firemen
I'm too hot -hot damn-
Make a dragon want to retire, man
I'm too hot -hot damn-
Say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot -hot damn-
And my band about that money
Break it down
<br> </br>
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Saturday night and we're in the spot
Don't believe me? just watch
-Come on!-
<br> </br>
Don't believe me? just watch
(bis)
<br> </br>
Stop, wait a minute
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign the check
Julio, get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we're going to show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
<br> </br>
I'm too hot -hot damn-
Call the police and the fireman
I'm too hot -hot damn-
Make a dragon want to retire, man
I'm too hot -hot damn-
Say my name you know who I am
I'm too hot -hot damn-
And my band about that money
Break it down
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Girls hit your hallelujah
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Because uptown funk going to give it to you
Saturday night and we're in the spot
Don't believe me? just watch
-Come on!-

Don't believe me? just watch

<br> </br>
Before we leave
Let me tell you all something
Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up
Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up
I said uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up
Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up
<br> </br>
Come on, dance, jump on it
If you're sexy then flaunt it
If you're freaky then own it
Don't brag about it, come show me
Come on, dance, jump on it
If you're sexy then flaunt it
Well it's Saturday night and we're in the spot
Don't believe me? just watch
(bis)

Uptown funk you up, uptown funk you up
-Say what?-
